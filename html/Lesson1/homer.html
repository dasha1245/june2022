    of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy,
    and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,
    and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main
    protagonist of The Simpsons Movie.</p>
