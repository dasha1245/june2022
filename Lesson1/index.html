<p>The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox
    Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart,
    Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.</p>
<p>The cartoon made its debut as 60-second animated bumpers for The Tracey Ullman Show, with the first short airing on
    April 19, 1987. The shorts were then expanded into a full-length 30-minute television spin-off by 20th Century Fox,
    first airing on December 17, 1989. As of 2021, 32 seasons have aired, with the 33rd airing since September 26.</p>
